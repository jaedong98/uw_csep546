# Homework4. Problem 2 Build your Best SMS Spam Model

## Jae Dong Hwang

### Build the Best SMS Spam Model

* Use the same version of the data used by the RandomForest assignment (with the calls to AddNoise.MakeProblemHarder).

* Use the three algorithms you’ve implemented.

* Use the featuring engineering you’ve implemented.

#### A report of no more than 1000 words with no more than 5 figures/tables which demonstrates that you have produced an effective model for the harder SMS problem (with added noise) and properly evaluated your model.

##### Demonstrate several parameter sweeps in your figures and highlight at least one area that indicates underfitting and one that indicates overfitting.

##### Make sure to use the appropriate techniques from the previous lectures (error bounds, various measures of model quality, categorized mistakes).

##### Examine your mistakes and improve your feature engineering in at least 3 ways. Describe the features your best model uses.

##### Include an ROC curve comparing the first model you tried with your final best model. Clearly label what they are.

##### Describe your best model and parameter settings. Include the estimate of the accuracy your best model achieves using cross validation on the training data and the estimate you get on the hold-out test set.
